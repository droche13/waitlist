Sign-Up Flow
    ◦    How come you enter your email then have to click continue and then enter your name?
    ◦    We have to make EVERYTHING about this service as simple as possible—that’s how we are going to win people over.
    ◦    The way this is currently set up can create issues because when I first entered in my email, I didn’t realize that it took me to the next fill-in section.
    ◦    This would create issues where users type their email in and think they’re signed up.
    ◦    Change this so you enter in your email and username on the same pop-up, and then you only need to click 1 button to submit, not 2 like it’s currently set up.

Countdown
    ◦    Assuming the countdown is just a demo/example.

Menu Bar / UX - done
    ◦    I think a menu bar at the top would be more beneficial than how the menu currently is, where you have to scroll down.
    ◦    Just easier visually, but not a huge deal.
    ◦    Later on, we’ll obviously need to keep adjusting UX and bar layout as we incorporate more options (such as categories, user accounts, etc.).

Pop-Up Titles & Descriptions
    ◦    Adding on to the point above, obviously this is just a demo, but the 3 pop-up titles and descriptions should be shorter.
    ◦    We need to act as if all our users have ADHD and don’t have the patience to read “all that” / or even care enough.
    ◦    Our users want answers quick, not a detailed analysis.
    ◦    Example: Instead of “What exactly is Idea Factory?” could make it “The Idea” / “Our Idea” followed by the description.
    ◦    Example description: We connect entrepreneurs, creators, and innovators in real Google Meet conversations—no fake LinkedIn “connections.” Just real people. Real ideas. Real momentum. (gpt made the descript. But u get the idea)

Video Setup
    ◦    If we have a video, how you set it up will need a thumbnail pic. (I’m sure this will be easy.)
    ◦    The video is currently a pop-up window inside the website. I think this should be frozen/framed so you can just scroll down without having to click out of the pop-up window.
